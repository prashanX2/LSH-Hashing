S11: it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multi mission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps

S13: the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm 2 sm 3 or sm 6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg 51 capability ddg 1000s advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability
S14: for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24 hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
S15: during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
S16: both of these businesses are co operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherfords odour issues and thats a very positive outcome
S17: we were able to analyse four samples from our odour capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporations sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
S18: based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
S19: hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible
S20: just notice your breath repeatedly constantly start with a few minutes do it regularly daily everyday no days off if you miss a day dont ruminate too much just pick it up and start again keeping it regular is very important it will bring order and a restfulness to your life off of the cushion as it were
S21: i would like to speak a moment about this concept of community as a meditator you are not alone you are not selfish because you take the time to notice your thoughts in fact you will come to see if you sit with any real regularity and commitment that your time sitting will alter maybe even transform your life with others in very beneficial harmonious ways i do not want to give you the impression that everything will be perfect and pleasant henceforward no this is not any humans reality that i have met and i have met the lowest and the highest of the caste no i just wanted to make certain that you heard the report from the front lines as it were that you are not alone ever never no how

S60: my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but im really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully theyll be kinder to me than i am on myself and thats part of the therapy
S61: ive been listening to carol on the radio for years but ive never seen her so this has been a great experience
S62: because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
S63: one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed youre being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
S64: also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but its a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
S65: and for people who have life long self esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
S66: this is why i work in radio and not television

S70: this course is slightly different its going to have a little more emphasis on problem solving and negotiation skills
S71: it will give men better skills and strategies for resolving conflict so it doesnt escalate into something else

S76: it was a bit of a surprise it just arrived
S77: its a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because were so diverse and the community dont really have an understanding of what we do
S78: the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
S79: disability services like mai wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
S80: this is a one off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
S81: this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand
S82: theres nothing more important in disability services than providing the challenge and opportunity to work in mainstream australia
S83: the staff are very excited about going in as are the residents and the families

S85: benhome provides a wonderful service to the local community and this further enhances what theyre able to do
S86: all governments are appreciative of not for profit organisations like the one here helping to engage the local community in the financial support of these facilities
S87: there shouldnt be any greater priority for government than to take care of elderly australians those who have contributed so much to the development of the nation
S88: weve got a rapidly ageing population so governments generally are going to have to look in the future at investing more into aged care facilities
S89: weve got an intergenerational challenge ahead of us to support older australians

S105: well yah i would say that at least four or five times a season someone now not always someone sitting in my seats but someone within a few seats gets hit usually you dont see the blood but usually you dont have someone wearing a white silk top to the game silk really shows off blood
S106: hey if you dont mind me asking braid how often do you sell your seats what you have had those season tickets for twenty or is it 30 years now
S107: actually coop i only sit in my seats if it is the playoffs i sell or give away the seats to every regular season game i clear at least seventy six thousand a year selling the seats

S128: were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
S129: its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
S130: the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see

S158: this path im on now is only something i arrived at after having fully explored my own dickiness
S159: why certain undisclosed charities would give money to pay overhead for what is essentially a charitable conduit
S160: williams insists that whenever a person gives money for a particular charity 100 per of that money gets to the named beneficiary that may be true but it does not mitigate the fact that the vast majority of the overall money collected during 2006 went to administration
S161: we charge nothing for donations collected online and even cover the credit card costs associated with each donation we rely on the support of generous donors and advertisers to provide this service
S162: we have a responsibility to scrutinize all charitable endeavours to ensure that we are getting decent value for our dollar
S163: the point of this letter is to emphasize both the general and specific importance of all of us making the effort to sign up so that our organs may be used after our death by others for whom they can be the gift of life and for the extra courageous and hearty there are organ and bodily donations that can happen while we are alive many people wait on lists desperately hoping for this miracle and any of us may find ourselves or a close loved one in need at some point in ourlives the sad fact is that a small fraction of the population has signed up to make such donations possible at least by the laws in bc without that few moments of paperwork our body parts will simply go to the grave or crematorium that follows and sign up asap if you live in another jurisdiction take a few minutes and find out how you can do the same consider forwarding this email to your friends your facebook site your network post on your blog or however you prefer lets create a wave of donors

S312: everyone who faces me says that the truth is that i have a difficult style and they find that out first hand when they fight me
S313: all his style did was make for an ugly stinky fight to watch and it was even more ugly to participate in it takes two to make a good fight and i couldnt give anything to make it a good fight i felt like i stunk out the joint that night
S314: its a misconception that i got old or that i took him lightly
S315: this time ill limit how much ill train for the fight
S316: i could have done more in the first fight because i knew what he was going to do its just that physically i couldnt adapt to what he did after four rounds i had nothing
S317: hes a master at holding without the referee seeing he holds and he tries to headbutt and elbow on his way in he even kneed me in the chest during one clinch thats why i hit him behind the head so i could draw attention from the ref vernon knows every trick in the book
S318: i think its going to be a more exciting fight this time

S543: we have found zambia to have potential it has political stability and leadership that is committed and farsighted it also has a wealth of resources
S544: i believe there is a good opportunity for malaysia to be involved in zambias growth

S559: she has failed the rakyat she has proven she is unfit to serve the people
S560: the people can see for themselves our contributions pr has done nothing they have not helped the malays especially those in the rural areas
S561: everyone has been talking about the discussions and their opinions are varied i fear we may go astray from the original objectives of the talks
S562: that is why i think we should let the leaders of both parties hold formal meetings to discuss matters of importance to umno and pas
S563: we could discuss fundamental issues such as religion and leave politics out
S564: such moves would only lead us to lose focus and force us to talk on old issues that have been a hindrance to closer relations between umno and pas
S565: if all is made known then it would become discussions via the media
S566: there is no basis for the state assembly to demand such a thing
S567: what right do they have to ask the federal government to pay them for the projects
S568: this is all just a political ploy by pakatan rakyat
S569: i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and saddam hussein

S572: it depends on how often we eat out usually its once or twice every weekend
S573: its better to go to regular sellers they recognise you and will keep the prices reasonable
S574: it further alleged that i had sold out and compromised gerakan the terms sold out and compromised the party essentially means that i have betrayed the party and cannot be trusted with the leadership of gerakan
S575: i just dont know how a book that tells the gerakan story can be interpreted as an attempt to defame someone
S576: we fully support anwar and the party will mobilise its machinery to ensure his victory
S577: i was informed about this development much earlier we will support him all the way
S578: i have lost twice i dont think the party will field me again
S579: i am a fighter i will fight for whoever the party fields as a candidate
S580: i have no problems with ezam former anwar ibrahim aide and pkr youth chief ezam mohd nor contesting the seat i think he will be a good candidate
S581: even the performance of the penang government since the elections is an issue
S582: we call it rezeki harimau we sometimes get a good catch or none at all i will spend more on groceries whenever i get siakap seabass or kerapu garoupa in big quantities
S583: we will keep more of these items before the rainy season my wife knows very well when to stock up on groceries
S584: i have to do it as i want my family to have good meals every day
S585: we have gone through hard times when there was no food at home i dont want my children to beg for food from relatives again
S586: theres nothing much to buy except fresh produce and items like milo and condensed milk
S587: it may raise eyebrows but my husband and children sometimes want to try other types of fish particularly selayang and kembong
S588: these types of fish are cheaper compared to stingray siakap and kerapu that my husband catches its better for him to sell the fish as we can get more money
S589: pas rejects any form of cooperation with umno or bari san nasional at state or federal level we will not be forming any government with them this is no longer an issue

S591: we want uthayakumar to say that the medicine he had with him appeared in the police search list but it was missing in the detention centres list
S592: he had the medicine when he was moved there we are dealing with a mans life
S593: the court is ready to hear it and so is the senior federal counsel but you are giving all sorts of excuses
S594: if you want this man to be either set free or admitted to a hospital you should proceed now if this was a civil court and you didnt follow the case management directions i would have thrown this case out it is a waste of time to file more affidavits
S595: the idea is to put it all into written submissions because there are too many affidavits
S596: as it is the court has been pushed and pressured just to suit lawyers
S597: i admit that i did it but i did not intend to threaten
S598: this is a serious offence you have taken advantage of a familys grief your action has caused them a lot of worry
S599: the court is not here just to give out punishments it is also to teach lessons
S600: he earns an income of rm450 and supports his four school going siblings he is remorseful of his action and will not do it again
S601: he could be thinking that as the former member of parliament there he would still enjoy good support from voters dr wan azizah took over the seat from anwar and she is now giving way to him
S602: we expected him to contest in permatang pauh although previously anwar said he might stand in bandar tun razak or kulim bandar baharu this shows that he has been misleading the people
S603: i do not think permatang pauh is really a safe seat for anwar taking into consideration all the controversies involving him at present
S604: having a by election involves a lot of work at this time we should be focusing on solving the problems faced by the people and not on pursuing ones personal ambitions
S605: they are treating permatang pauh as a family playground where they can simply pass the baton as and how they like
S606: maybe we should identify a new candidate and not someone who had previously contested there and lost what is important is that he or she must be a party member
S607: umno has gone through various challenges i believe that our machinery would be able to fight against anwar
S608: in the march general election the voters did not reject umno totally what we have to do is to convince them as to why they must support umno and barisan nasional
S609: the general election was just held five months ago barisan nasional would give a strong fight this time around as now the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawis leadership is more stable
S610: we in mic are also stronger with our continuous rebuilding and we will give our full support to ensure victory
S611: even if anwar wins it will not make any difference as barisan nasional would still continue to rule the country
S612: but when i read these right finger i always carefully consider the good price because i can always get the s ads and the retailers descriptions
S613: ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
S614: my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
S615: i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
S616: i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
S617: ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
S618: i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it
S619: if i could describe the new national defense strategy in one word it would be balance
S620: for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s

S622: we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
S623: we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
S624: the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies

S637: we sailed for about an hour and a half then decided to head in to avoid damaging the mast in a capsize but not before some radical downwind surfing
S638: when we got onshore we were advised to lash down our boats as the winds were predicted to get stronger overnight
S639: i have not had any problems with my boat but i may have to wait a couple of days since few people will sail with their racing spars in the strong winds predicted for the next two days
S640: our plan tomorrow today will be dependent on what the weather looks like and i suspect the gym and pool are going to be popular for most of the day
S641: no point trying to be a hero before the battle actually begins
S642: we are not happy at all im not sure if muraleedharans job will still be secure after the council meeting as his position as coach will definitely be discussed
S643: we have less than a year to prepare the players for the junior world cup
S644: if new blood should be injected and coaches be replaced then we will go ahead
S645: however we are disappointed with the 102 former internationals for not speaking to us first
S646: we would have taken them seriously and considered their proposals
S647: however we are not holding any grudges as whats done is done and we must now look ahead
S648: we are aware that several parties have received copies of the petition but as for now we are prepared to work with these players regardless what comes next
S649: i heard they are interested to contribute through the grassroots and we welcome their ideas
S650: i cant comment on the players meeting with sultan azlan shah and mazlan we will just wait and see
S651: all reports regarding the coaches and players performance and also documents on the countrys coaching system since 2006 have been given to jegathesan to review
S652: what we are doing is collaborating with the mssm the idea is good as teachers will be more involved in coaching and umpiring
S653: i would love to race against him but i dont think i would be drawn in the same heat as him
S654: the top swimmers will all be grouped into the seeded championship heats and my times wont get me into those heats
S655: i said that about the world championships in melbourne last year and i dont think it is going to be any different in beijing
S656: it will also be the toughest to make the semis the toughest to make the finals and the toughest to win
S657: whether that results in world records all the time or whether the world records will come in the finals i think were going to have to wait and see what happens
S658: it wont be a two horse race between australia and the united states i mean you look at countries like britain japan the french the south africans they perform very solidly
S659: theyve made changes from going to the semis to the finals to lower medals to gold medals theres a major shift in world swimming

S675: i never let myself be influenced by tension and i wont start now ive just to keep my focus and continue to give as much as possible race after race thats what ive done every time i was in trouble
S676: its still much too early to make any forecasts for the championship considering that the first three drivers are only seven points apart the positions can change in a single race
S677: and its useless to cry over spilled milk we are looking ahead with eight races to go and at the end well do the maths we just passed the halfway point of the season so its important to always gain points
S678: excluding hockenheim i was always in a position to win and i hope success will come soon

S684: i was playing so bad that it wasnt even fun
S685: i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
S686: what almost killed umno in the last elections is not the leaders but the supporters who leech on them to further their own personal interests
S687: if the leadership does not listen to us now i can guarantee we will continue to lose seats in the 13th general election
S688: you would be shocked at how many members and leaders did not go out to vote
S689: during the general election a supreme council member will ask whether weve eaten whether we are tired whether we are okay now they tell us what resolutions we can and cannot adopt
S690: there was this resolution by a branch that wanted all umno ministers wives to wear the tudung
S691: that was not passed as the division felt it was not the partys place to force them to do it
S692: but every resolution passed or adopted will be in the annual general meeting report
S693: if your resolution is not accepted you can still request that it be debated at the division meeting and this request will be put to a vote if you get enough votes from all the divisions at the meeting it will be accepted and debated
S694: these days branch members are professionals and they know the partys history and its constitution if i want to be a delegate to the division they will ask me what im about and whom i support for this or that post
S695: if i do not answer correctly i will not be chosen and the person who best represents their aspirations will be and that delegate will go to the division and have a hand in forming the partys direction
S696: the extremely high subsidies by the us have caused serious damage to cotton farmers in developing countries including those in africa and 150 million in china
S697: we believe that the us is not in a position to discuss with developing countries members cotton tariffs until they eliminate their cotton subsidies
S698: one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the us
S699: i come from a country where 300 million people live on us 1 a day and 700 million people live on us 2 a day so it is natural for me and in fact incumbent upon me to see that our agricultural interests are not compromised you dont require rocket science to decide between livelihood security and commercial interests
S700: its unfortunate that in a development round we couldnt agree to an issue of livelihood and security
S701: looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty
S702: i was living in akita at the time i fitted in almost immediately met numerous great jazz musicians and was blown away by their skills

S735: you need the backing of a strong team and i have been privileged to have had that from my federal and state colleagues
S736: its also critical to have the absolute support of your family so you can put the people you represent first
S737: parliamentary sittings committee work and other duties of a federal member take you away from home for a good six months of the year
S738: fortunately i have had the full support of wendy and my daughters who have been prepared to sacrifice family time with me so i could do that job effectively
S739: at a recent council meeting representatives from surf lifesaving services australia said 51 people were rescued at the beaches over the past few years
S740: how can a council ignore the principles of competitive neutrality and use general revenue to prop up a poorly performing business unit at the expense of an essential service that saves lives
S741: tourism in this area will be seriously affected by councils decision to not protect their beaches just so it can maintain market share in an area where there is a viable non council alternative
S742: ratepayers should not be punished for councils mismanagement of funds and resources
S743: how many more reports findings and data have to be released saying the same thing before governments sit up and listen
S744: councils are at financial breaking point and are struggling to provide the services and facilities their ratepayers need and deserve
S745: rate pegging is a big problem because it hampers councils ability to set rates according to local needs but a low share of federal taxation revenue skyrocketing election costs and population pressures are also contributing
S746: cost shifting is a continuing issue and the state governments recent planning laws are a classic example they mean a bunch of new panels and systems which councils dont support but will have to fund
S747: if the government supports iparts recommendation to remove councils exemption from payroll tax and increase our contribution to state run fire services ratepayers will again lose
S748: while the infrastructure data used by fiscal star needs to be improved to make the findings for each council more reliable and less alarmist the general conclusions are the same as the independent report into the financial sustainability of local government released in 2006 and various other surveys and findings since
S749: the removal of rate pegging and a greater share of federal taxation are part solutions but the state government also needs to stop cost shifting and start supporting local councils and their ratepayers
S750: councils are committed to their communities and are good at providing for them but are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs

S851: well we need to do a heart biopsy and the ones who do that are the doctors who handle transplants
S852: but im also not just going in there until you know the risks so in a transplant patient to do a biopsy of the heart to see if theyre rejecting it isnt a big deal but with you phil the risk is five fold and its by no means a simple little procedure if you want i can go in there and biopsy but when i do that the heart can tear and make a hole which well isnt good see the heart is like steak you know how a flank steak can just tear well essentially im going in there and taking bites out of your heart im telling you all of this because you need to know the risks and some people would rather not have the biopsies theyd rather not know whats going on
S853: because given all you have atrial fibrillation complete stage three heart block and most concerning in all of this a very low velocity and very erratic heart trace something is wrong and very abnormal something bigger is probably going on now usually you have symptoms you come in complaining about your gallbladder or something and we narrow it down to the heart but everything about this situation is well something weve never seen before
S854: if we do the biopsy hopefully well be able to rule out certain heart diseases namely infiltrated cardiomyopothy amyloidosis myocarditis but other things as well the bad thing with doing a biopsy aside from the risks involved with tearing is that sometimes a biopsy yields nothing
S855: is you might not like the results i might tell you that you have something that cannot be cured that even a transplant wont fix and some people dont want that kind of knowledge so they elect not to do the biopsy ill let you two talk it over
S856: stephanie i just have to say it one thing im scared about is that im going to die tomorrow

S880: the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
S881: even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
S882: i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault

S887: left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
S888: whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
S889: when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own

S899: o tribunal constitucional pronunciou se pela inconstitucionalidade de v rias normas do decreto que aprovou a revis o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores nesse sentido irei devolver nos termos da lei o respectivo diploma assembleia da rep blica
S900: devo no entanto comunicar aos portugueses que outras normas me suscitam s rias reservas de natureza pol tico institucional
S901: trata se acima de tudo da norma relativa dissolu o da assembleia legislativa dos a ores que inovando em rela o ao estatuto em vigor e em rela o ao estatuto da madeira restringe o exerc cio das compet ncias pol ticas do presidente da rep blica pondo em causa o equil brio e a configura o de poderes do nosso sistema pol tico previsto na constitui o
S902: em devido tempo alertei v rios dirigentes pol ticos para esta quest o
S903: nos termos da constitui o a assembleia legislativa regional pode ser dissolvida pelo presidente da rep blica ouvidos o conselho de estado e os partidos nela representados
S904: o diploma em causa pretende agora consagrar o dever adicional de o presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa os seus grupos e representa es parlamentares e o presidente do governo regional
S905: quer isto dizer que o presidente da rep blica estaria sujeito a mais deveres de audi o e consulta no que toca dissolu o da assembleia regional dos a ores do que os previstos para a dissolu o da assembleia da rep blica
S906: no caso da assembleia da rep blica o presidente da rep blica nos termos constitucionais n o precisa de ouvir a assembleia da rep blica nem o primeiro ministro mas no caso da assembleia legislativa dos a ores teria de ouvir a pr pria assembleia legislativa regional e o presidente do governo regional
S907: a audi o aut noma do presidente do governo regional tanto mais incompreens vel quanto ele tem assento no conselho de estado e a ouvido pelo presidente da rep blica
S908: o mesmo se pode dizer relativamente audi o aut noma da assembleia legislativa e dos seus grupos parlamentares porquanto nos termos constitucionais o presidente da rep blica j ouve os partidos nela representados
S909: entendo que perigoso para o princ pio fundamental da separa o e interdepend ncia de poderes que alicer a o nosso sistema pol tico aceitar o precedente que poderia ser invocado no futuro de por lei ordin ria como o caso do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores se vir a impor obriga es e limites s compet ncias dos rg os de soberania que n o sejam expressamente autorizados pela constitui o da rep blica
S910: semelhante pr tica desfiguraria o equil brio de poderes tal como este tem existido e afectaria o normal funcionamento das institui es da rep blica por isso que considero ser meu dever alertar os portugueses
S911: devo igualmente chamar a aten o para um outro ponto conexo com o anterior
S912: no passado dia 10 deste m s foi publicada uma lei da assembleia da rep blica sobre o estatuto do representante da rep blica nas regi es aut nomas no qual se estipula tal como consta da constitui o que o representante nomeado e exonerado pelo presidente da rep blica ouvido o governo
S913: sobre exactamente o mesmo assunto o decreto da assembleia da rep blica que aprova o novo estatuto dos a ores acrescenta a obriga o do presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa da regi o
S914: n o se questiona a audi o da assembleia regional na pessoa do seu presidente foi isso que fiz no in cio do meu mandato quando nomeei os representantes da rep blica para os a ores e para a madeira pr tica que ali s segui quando desempenhei as fun es de primeiro ministro e que tenciono manter como presidente da rep blica
S915: mas se aquela audi o tiver por objecto o pr prio rg o colegial podem emergir consequ ncias negativas no processo de designa o do representante
S916: por um lado porque pode colocar o presidente da rep blica no centro de um debate parlamentar regional e por outro porque pode fragilizar politicamente o representante da rep blica e dificultar a escolha de uma personalidade com perfil adequado
S917: considero ainda que merecem repondera o outras normas inovadoras constantes do estatuto
S918: por um lado o procedimento de audi o qualificada que pelas vincula es que cria para os rg os de soberania envolvidos restringe os seus poderes de decis o ultrapassando em muito a regulamenta o do simples direito de audi o previsto na constitui o
S919: por outro lado a limita o dos poderes de revis o do estatuto pela assembleia da rep blica s normas que tenham sido objecto da iniciativa da assembleia legislativa a oriana implica restri es excessivas ao poder de iniciativa legislativa superveniente dos deputados do parlamento nacional
S920: face incerteza que caracteriza os tempos modernos a possibilidade de petrifica o de normas jur dicas constantes do estatuto ao ponto de eternizar a sua vig ncia deve ser examinada com todo o cuidado
S921: a altera o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores visa concretizar o modelo avan ado de autonomia resultante da revis o constitucional de 2004 mas indispens vel que essa altera o se harmonize com a separa o de poderes e as compet ncias dos rg os de soberania consagrados na constitui o da rep blica portuguesa

S923: we had kind of a cool may and a warmer april but nothing unusual

S951: there are around 41 fewer first time buyers now than at the same time last year
S952: hat there is ongoing major downward pressure on house prices from extremely weak market activity stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south given that the bank of england reported extremely low mortgage approvals for house purchases in june while latest survey evidence shows that house sales are depressed buyer interest is weak it is taking longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
S953: its clear that gordon brown failed to prepare our economy during his 10 years at the treasury and now hard pressed families are paying the price
S954: this correction in house prices is happening because the government allowed the market to get hopelessly out of control
S955: interest rate cuts are clearly not on the agenda in the near term
S956: which would clearly be very bad news for the housing market
S957: affected by this regrettable situation in particular to those who had received an inaccurate diagnosis
S958: i can confirm that 17 patients were initially informed incorrectly that they did not have a malignancy such as cancer however we must emphasise that a number of these patients would have undergone precautionary treatment anyway or been subject to ongoing clinical review
S959: furthermore we can now give absolute assurance that all patients are now following the correct course of treatment
S960: our highest priority throughout has been the care and wellbeing of our patients and we have acted as quickly as possible to make sure that the review was carried out thoroughly and effectively
S961: the patients involved have generally appreciated the efforts we have made to investigate this situation and to recheck individually their samples diagnosis and treatment and i thank them all for their patience and understanding no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
S962: where necessary those patients have had their treatment amended we would like to reassure patients that individual details will not be made public
S963: clearly everyone affected will be concerned that not having received the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time has adversely affected their chances of recovery or worsened their prognosis
S964: this is not the first time that a large group of people have been harmed by what appears to have involved the poor judgment of a histopathologist which is why a careful multi disciplinary approach to diagnosis and assessment of treatment modality is so important
S965: an episode such as this demands an independent inquiry into what went wrong so that lessons can be learned across the health service

S967: unless we reach some kind of resolution in the next 48 hours this whole thing will have been an expensive waste of time
S968: the devil may be in the detail of the implementation report to be published in the autumn
S969: lack of commitment from nhs management at all levels has impeded progress in implementing informatics support for patient care
S970: if we were to criticise it would be that there is little recognition or emphasis on building from experience as a profession we have extensive experience on the issues and problems of health informatics we hope this will be used too much emphasis on central development sometimes ignores this fund of knowledge
S971: ticket sales have been brisk and our inventory is dwindling by the day

S974: the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
S975: many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
S976: the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
